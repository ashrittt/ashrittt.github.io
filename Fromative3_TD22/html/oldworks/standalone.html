                <p> <br>Peter Pan took out his hand infront of me while observing me.
                    <br>"Come lost boy, have fun with us?" He asked.
                    <br>
                    <br> And ever since that day, I became a lost boy of Neverland,
                    <br>That always hangs out with Peter pan, with other Lost Boys in Neverland.
                    <br>Running away from Captain Hook, playing swords and fight. Running away from the reality,
                    laughing
                    <br> all the way around.
                    <br>
                    <br>For a moment, staying with them had me thinking;
                    <br>I finally had a family. And this made me happy.
                    <br> I am finally free. No worries and nothing bothersome to see.

                    <br> Now it's my turn to be Peter Pan,
                    <br> As I took my hand out to the boy infront of me asking him,
                    <br>"Come lost boy, have fun with us?"
                    <br>
                    <br> -A.L

                    <br><br>
                    <br> Mirror Mirror on the wall,
                    <br> Can I be happy at all?
                    <br>
                    <br>If I can see people with their joyful expressions,
                    <br> It made me held a hope that I can ease this depression.

                    <br> I have never felt any ecstasy in my life,
                    <br>Hoping I have enough more time.
                    <br>
                    <br>Free my soul from the shackles and chains of sadness and bitterness,
                    <br>And step slowly into the path of Happiness.
                    <br>
                    <br>But am I happy at all?
                    <br>Or It's all imaginations to make myself fall?
                    <br>
                    <br>Deep into Ocean of Blues hugging myself,
                    <br>Thinking am I really alone with myself,
                    <br>
                    <br>In this narrow world, imaginations,
                    <br> Feelings faked or mirrored versions of myself,
                    <br>
                    <br> Mirror of the wall, let me see my reflection,
                    <br> And my resistance to this feelings I have
                    <br>
                    <br> To see how far could I go on?
                    <br> How far should I take the steps with a heavy feet?
                    <br>
                    <br>Mirror Mirror on the wall,
                    <br>I will be more happy at future and all.

                    <br> Kiss me before the sunrise, and don't leave me behind.<br>As my love had find its place in your
                    soul,
                    resting peacefully.
                    <br>Hoping the melody of heartbeat of yours won't stop as we walk through the path of forever.
                    <br>And if we could only change this world, today with you, I would fell more ecstasy.
                    <br> Always and forever, meant to be together.

                    <br>Titled: Strawberry Mentos
                    <br>
                    <br>Strawberry Mentos are too sweet for me, but I can bear to eat it as I felt your sweetness you
                    gave
                    <br>to me everytime you kissed me. Always check if my teeth would fall out, or either get cavities,
                    from
                    <br>the Strawberry Mentos you gave me, but I know it's worth it as I knew you were the one.
                    <br>
                    <br>-A.L

                    <br><br><br>Titled: Sorry, I like you too
                    <br>
                    <br>There was a boy I liked, but he doesn't know. He was like a bully to me for some reason, as he
                    will
                    <br>do some things that can lead me to anger. But what can I do? I can only be angry for a moment
                    but as
                    <br>I saw those wide smile he has, and those bright eyes, I can only sigh and think, "How did I fall
                    in
                    <br> love with person?"
                    <br>
                    <br> One time, when he blocked my way at the corridor where no students around, I confronted him,
                    asking,
                    <br> "Why are you doing this? Is it fun to see me like this?"
                    <br>
                    <br> He looked at me with a smile, "Well, I want to see your angry face because only with this, I
                    can
                    <br> grab your attention."
                    <br>
                    <br> I looked at him confusedly, which he answered, "I like you." With the serious bright eyes he
                    had,
                    <br> there's no trace of lies behind.
                    <br>
                    <br> "Are you pranking me?" I asked carefully. I don't have any hopes for him to like me, I'm not
                    that
                    narcissistic.
                    <br>
                    <br>"No. Seriously, I like you a lot. I like you every seconds and hours, day after day, I still
                    like
                    <br>you." He said.
                    <br>
                    <br> With embarrassed face, I immediately kicked him at the stomach. "Sorry.." I said, patting his
                    back
                    <br> after that kick.

                    <br> He looked at me sadly, "Was I..." Before he can continue his words, I immediately shut his
                    mouth
                    with a kiss, and said to him,
                    <br>
                    <br> "Sorry, I like you too."
                    <br>
                    <br>-A.L

                    <br><br><br> Titled: Wildest dreams
                    <br>
                    <br> I'm staring on the sunset while sitting on the tree trunk. I was wondering why would this
                    happen to
                    <br> me? Does my fate really that miserable? My eyes began to tear up when I dazed back to the past.
                    You
                    <br> were the most dazzling person I met, and you're the only one who I loved. But there's a thin
                    wall
                    <br> separates us, causing us to have conflicts. But I never thought, that thin wall can completely
                    <br> destroy our love. Should I love you more that time? Should I just break that thin wall and come
                    over
                    <br> to your side so I can be with you more? If only I have one more chance, a chance that can make
                    <br> myself drag to your arms one more. To change our fates. But I can only wish on the stars or in
                    my
                    <br> dreams, as I saw you holding other woman's hand.
                    <br>
                    <br> Until the sun sets complete, and only my sobbing can be heard in this lonely dark night. If I
                    can
                    <br> only bet and wish on my wildest dreams, to make you remember me, and our past, or to turn back
                    to
                    <br> the time so I can save you that night.
                    <br>
