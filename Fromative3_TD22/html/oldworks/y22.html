                <p> <br>Everything stopped for a minute ‚Äî
                    <br>What happened in a glimpse of seconds?
                    <br>Never thought the hours I asked myself
                    <br>Would pass me by without knowing.
                    <br>
                    <br>Why ‚Äî my only question in life ‚Äî
                    <br>Did you lose your feelings away?
                    <br>For a time, I kept on wondering,
                    <br>Where was the love we gave away?
                    <br>
                    <br>I was a yearner, a lover;
                    <br>No label, no title, no cover.
                    <br>But I loved you in every way I could,
                    <br>Because I thought you were the one.
                    <br>
                    <br>Now I‚Äôm broken ‚Äî
                    <br>Crying in a mess I can‚Äôt fathom,
                    <br>Lost in the ruins you left behind,
                    <br>Trying to remember who I was before you.
                    <br>
                    <br>Why did you choose her, not me?
                    <br>I stayed when things turned stormy.
                    <br>I tried to hold and understand,
                    <br>Even as love slipped from my hand.
                    <br>
                    <br>I can‚Äôt bring myself back to light,
                    <br>I wish you‚Äôd tell me I was right.
                    <br>But silence grew, the pain remained ‚Äî
                    <br>You left before I spoke your name.
                    <br>
                    <br>Our love became a long goodbye,
                    <br>A fleeting dream that passed me by.
                    <br>No reason left, no need to fight ‚Äî
                    <br>You found your heart in someone‚Äôs light.
                    <br>
                    <br>I called you special, meant it true,
                    <br>But you chose her instead of you.
                    <br>The breeze of love has lost its flare,
                    <br>And I‚Äôm still here ‚Äî alone, laid bare.
